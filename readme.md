1. Create project directory from github using git clone.
2. Install the gems using bundle install
3. Run app.rb using ruby app.rb
4. Runs on localhost:4567 and message will be displayed:

Puma starting in single mode...
* Version 3.9.1 (ruby 2.4.0-p0), codename: Private Caller
* Min threads: 0, max threads: 16
* Environment: development
* Listening on tcp://localhost:4567

All required functionality is completed. And, the Place Order functionality has been added.

Note: I wanted to try a new framework and used Sinatra and Sinatra Active-Records and I ran into some roadblocks that took extra time.
